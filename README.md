<h1>From Novice to Ninja: My Hashedin Internship Experience</h1>

During the initial days of the Internship, we were at Hashedin University. This is a 2-month program by Hashedin to train Interns.

During the 6 month Internship in Hahsedin by Deloitte I had the opportunity to work on two
projects. Both of these projects were created from scratch. <br/>
During these days in the Hashedin new interns are called
Linkers. They go through rigorous training from basic to advanced over 5 weeks.<br/>
In the first week, we were given a challenge to create a few web pages using
HTML CSS and git basics.<br/>
2nd week: A project in React <br/>
3rd week: A project in Spring boot <br/>
4th week: A project in Python Django <br/>
5th week: A complete end-to-end project with either Python Django-React
or Spring Boot- React. <br/>
During these 5 weeks, we were working individually and trying to survive
each week. <br/>
<br/>
For the remaining days in the 2 months journey of the Hashed University
I was put in a team with other linkers to create a project and compete
with other teams. Out of many project ideas, we were given a project to
demonstrate how can we create a <b>Mutual Fund Portfolio Analyzer</b> using
Mulesoft. <br/>
I was working as a backend developer and worked on both Mulesoft and
Spring boot application.
<br/> <br/>
After HU, we became Hashers.

The first project I got after becoming Hasher was HBS. A tool that lets users easily highlight any text on blogs, articles, documents, and web pages. 
Just like marking important lines in books and papers, Highlighter allows you to save and revisit key points effortlessly, making your online reading experience more organized and efficient. We created this
product from scratch. It was a team of four developers. I worked as a backend-developer with one front-end developer, one lead developer working
as a front-end developer, and a Product Manager.
We successfully created this project and hosted it on the Google Store.
A complete usable product without any bugs.
